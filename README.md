# Cyclable: DO NOT OCCUPY THE BIKE LANE

## Product Vision Statement

Cyclable is a route planning web application designed to enhance the cycling experience in New York City by integrating real-time user reports on road constructions and bike lane blockages. The app ensures smoother, safer rides for cyclists by providing up-to-date information on disruptions and generating alternative routes that prioritize safety. Cyclists will be able to report blockages or construction in real-time, view an interactive map displaying current bike lanes and reported issues, and plan safer routes that avoid these disruptions. Additionally, users will have the option to save frequently used routes for future reference, making it easier to navigate the city on subsequent trips.

In the future, Cyclable may include advanced features such as photo recognition, enabling users to submit blockages by taking pictures that can be analyzed by computer vision algorithms for more detailed reporting. The app could also introduce social functionalities, allowing cyclists to add friends, share routes, and collaborate on ride planning.

Cyclable’s mission is to make biking in NYC more accessible and enjoyable for all, allowing cyclists to better utilize the city’s bike lane infrastructure despite ongoing challenges.

## Project History

Cyclable was born out of a common frustration among cyclists in New York City: despite a growing network of bike lanes, disruptions such as construction, blockages, and traffic often force cyclists into unsafe detours. The idea behind Cyclable is to leverage the collective knowledge of the cycling community to report these blockages in real-time, ensuring safer and more efficient routes for everyone.
